      <Value>[Name:Guild of Merchants Note 1][Text:Hello $Name$. I trust this letter finds you well.
Hopefully, by the time you read this, you will have done the basic task of setting up a $WorldObject_112$. It wouldn't do at all for our Merchants to arrive and find themselves without a place to trade.
According to our records, $Actor_36$ will be arriving on Wednesday, and $Actor_38$ will be arriving on Friday.
As with all Merchants, they will be willing to purchase most things from you. However, due to their limited carrying capacity, I suggest you sell them only items that they are actively looking for.
$Actor_36$ has a keen eye for monster parts and relics from before the war, while $Actor_38$ is looking for wands and herbs local to your area.
May fortune favour you.
Yours, Delian Fortenay, Guild of Merchants][Day:2][Month:1][Year:1]</Value>
