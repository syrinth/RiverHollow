      <Value>Nice to see you hon, we don't get too many customers on cold days like this. Why don't you treat yourself to something warm at the bar?</Value>

      <Key>Snowing_2</Key>
      <Value>Sometimes, days like these remind me of when $Character_9$ and I first met. It was the dead of winter and he'd just come into the tavern I was performing at, bundled up in his coat. There was something about him that caught my eye immediately.</Value>

      <Key>Rain_1</Key>
      <Value>You know, I kind of love the rain now that I'm not on the road anymore. I hated it back then though. Now? It's nice to be warm inside and watch it fall.</Value>

      <Key>Dialogue_3</Key>
      <Value>Best be careful if you're gonna go exploring hon, I was out on the edge of the forest the other day, just minding my own business when I saw something creeping around. I didn't get a good look at it, but it didn't seem like a good idea to stick around.</Value>
