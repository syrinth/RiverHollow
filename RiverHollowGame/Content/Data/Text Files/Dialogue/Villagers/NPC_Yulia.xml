	  Oh? A town you say? That sounds... lovely. It will be nice to see people around I suppose. I've been alone here for a long time.][Name:Introduction]</Value>

      <Value>[Text:You know... now that I've settled in, I was thinking. This town could really use an $Building_24$. It's been so long since I've taught anyone. My Jesse would sit at my knees and listen to my tell him the names of all the plants and herbs...
If you could build me such a place, that would make an old woman very happy.][ShopTargetID:2][UnlockItemID:137][Once][Default][Priority:50][Name:Apothecary_Request]</Value>

      <Value>[Text:I was wondering if you could help me. A few days ago, a monster crept into my house and scared the daylights out of me! The worst part though, was that the little thief stole my book of recipes and made off towards the Forest Temple to the North!
	  You look like someone equipped to deal with monsters, would it be too much trouble to ask you to go and get it for me? I've had that book for years, and all of my most important recipes are in it.
	  Thank you so much!
	  It ran North, to the Forest Temple. You'll need to make an offering at the door to get it open, so make sure you find a $Item_162$. I've got some $Item_142$ that I've been saving, but you'll need it as well, so here. Good luck, and be careful!][Name:Task_3_Start][ItemID:142]</Value>
