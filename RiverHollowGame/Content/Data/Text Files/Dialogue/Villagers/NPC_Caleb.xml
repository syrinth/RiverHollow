      <Value>[Name:Task_0_Start][Text:We have to build a $WorldObject_112$ so that visiting merchants will have a place to trade goods. You'll need wooden planks and some clay to build it.
	  I've got some extra planks in the chest there, but you'll need to find the clay yourself. I think I saw a cave in the woods where you that should be able to find some. Just follow the cleared path to the West.
	  Once you've got that, choose a spot, set it up, and let me know when you're done, OK?][UnlockObjectID:112]</Value>

      <Value>[Name:Task_0_End][Text:Is the $WorldObject_112$ finished? Great! The Merchant's Guild knows we're here, so there should be someone along soon but that leaves the little problem of us not having anything to sell  yet.
...
So, before we left, I reached out to my colleagues to see what would be a good idea to start with. They pointed out that Kethris Tower isn't too far away, so we'd likely get a lot of mages coming through to the North.
A Wandmaker was supposed to have arrived today, to supply the apprentices with weapons but she hasn't arrived yet.
	  Could you check the woods again for me?
	  Oh, and before I forget, here's a chest for you to hold items in. Place it anywhere you want, and take a look through these notes when you have a minute.][Face:Happy]</Value>
