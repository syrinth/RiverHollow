      <Value>[Text:Already done? Great work. With the $Building_35$ built, we can make bricks and planks. It's kind of hard to build a town without them, you know.

Here, I drew up some plans for a house for you. You should get that built before nightfall, better to have your own space.][Face:Happy][UnlockBuildingID:22]</Value>
