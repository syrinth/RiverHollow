      <Value>[Text:Welcome to the Adventurer's Guild. I'm $Actor_5$, the guildmaster here. It's good to see a new face in town.
If you decide to put some of that land to use constructing housing, I can get you in contact with other adventurers.][Name:Introduction]</Value>

      <Value>[Text:So, you're an adventurer too are you? I wouldn't wander too far in these lands without some extra help, and luckily for you, I can supply it.
If you're willing to house and provision them, you can hire adventurers to join you.
The first I'd recommend is a $Class_5$ and $Class_6$. You should build yourself a $Building_2$ to house them.][Name:Quest2End]</Value>

      <Value>[Text:Back when I was younger, adventurers were far more common. They would use the guilds in towns to share news and information. It was amazing how fast word could spread that way.
Nowadays though, it's rare to see a new face all year.][Default][Name:6]</Value>
