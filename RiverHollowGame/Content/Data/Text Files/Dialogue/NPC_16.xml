      <Value>So, you're an adventurer too are you? I wouldn't wander too far in these lands without some extra help, and luckily for you, I can supply it.
If you're willing to house and provision them, you can hre adventurers tyo join you.
The first I'd recommend is a Knight and Lancer. You should build yourself a Barracks to House them.</Value>
