      <Value>Welcome to the Adventurer's Guild. I'm $Character_16$, guildmaster here. It's good to see a new face in town. You can hire adventurers here, as long as you have housing for them as well as send them on missions.</Value>

      <Value>So, you're an adventurer too are you? I wouldn't wander too far in these lands without some extra help, and luckily for you, I can supply it.
If you're willing to house and provision them, you can hire adventurers to join you.
The first I'd recommend is a $Class_5$ and $Class_6$. You should build yourself a $Building_2$ to house them.</Value>
