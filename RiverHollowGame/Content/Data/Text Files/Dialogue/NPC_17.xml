      <Value>I hope you can help me. Some upstart goblins snuck into my house last night and stole my orb. It's very precious to me, and I want it back. If you get it for me, I'll make it worth your while.</Value>

      <Value>Ah! You've arrived.
An artisan yes? I've never had the patience for that kind of thing. No, I prefer towield my magic more directly. It's a useful skill though, one I'm glad you're bringing to the town.
Here. It's not much, just a few odds and ends I had laying around but it should get you started.</Value>
