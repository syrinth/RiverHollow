	  My name? OH! $Actor_20$. I'm $Actor_20$, and this is the Blue Hare Inn. I know it's not much, but it's not too shabby right? It was the first thing $Actor_16$ built when we got here, and I even tried to help a bit.
	  I've been spending the past few days getting it ready for you and our other guests.]</Value>

	  Everyone has their own likes and dislikes though, so try to keep it varied if you can. Happy travelers will spend more money in town before they leave.
	  Speaking of, I set these aside for you...]</Value>
