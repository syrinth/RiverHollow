	  ...
	  Oh, right. I'm $Actor_16$, and I'll help you get started. You are the Builder right? You match the description they sent, but you know what they say about assuming things.
	  You brought your tools yeah? You seem the professional sort. Take your time looking around, get used to swinging your tools a bit, and then meet me at the $WorldObject_39$ on the East of Town when you're ready.
	  I'm really looking forward to working with you.]</Value>
