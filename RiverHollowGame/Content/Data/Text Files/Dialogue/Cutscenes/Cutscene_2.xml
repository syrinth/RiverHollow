      <Value>[Name][Text:So I've placed the main things you need to worry about right here. Place any logs you want cut into planks in the bin on the left, and every day when I finish work, I'll place the lumber on the table in front of us. The $WorldObject_92$ is over here...]</Value>

      <Value>[Name][Text:Like most buildings, we've got a machine here. If you interact with it, you can see what I can make as well as how much I can process in a day.
	  We're going to need a lot of lumber going forward, so I need you to keep me stocked so we can stay ahead of any building needs we may have.
	  Oh, and before I forget, you should know I also sell, furniture, and other decorative items for the town.]</Value>
