      <Value>[Text:Tell me. Do you know what this place is?
	  I thought not.
	  Far in the past, there was a people who lived in this land called the Aedians. According to legend, they lived together with the spirits of the land. They left behind multiple statues and carvings of the spirits behind them.
	  No one is really sure about what became of them and it's one mystery among many this land holds that I hope to unravel.
	  But first, I will have to rest. I have been down here too long.
	  ...
	  A town you say? How serendipitous. I know the clearing you speak of, I shall meet you there.]</Value>
