      <Value>[Text:Hey, $Name$. So I was thinking that now that we've got an $Building_9$ we're going to need a way to make money. We've got a lot of resources nearby, so I think starting with potions might be the best bet.
I've enclosed the designs for a $Building_8$, the faster you build it, the faster we can hopefully start attracting more people.][UnlockBuildingID:8]</Value>

      <Value>[Text:I've spoken with $Character_14$ and set him to work. Go see him in his shop when you're ready to start work on a $Building_18$.][ShopTargetID:2][UnlockItemID:172]</Value>

      <Value>[Text:Hey, thanks for the house. It's really roomy here. Now that I'm settled in, I thought maybe  I could open up a $Building_32$? I used to run one a few years ago. I spoke with $Character_14$ and he told me to tell you to see him.

No rush, but I think it'd help liven up the town.][ShopTargetID:2][UnlockItemID:171]</Value>
