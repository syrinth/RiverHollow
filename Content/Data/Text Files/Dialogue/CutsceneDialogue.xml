        <Item>[IntroText:A long time ago, a great war broke out between the three kingdoms. Many lives were lost and as a result, much knowledge and hope was lost in the land. There is one place, however, where the spark of hope still burns, although the fires are quite low. That place, is River Hollow.]</Item>
